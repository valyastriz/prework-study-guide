        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="boldit">CSS</span> defines the style of the page.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS:</li>
          <ul>
            <li class="special">Inline CSS</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This is used when you want to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
              <li>Apply to a specific HTML tag, uxing a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
              <li>Useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="special">Internal CSS Style Sheet</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Embeds an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file.</li>
              <li>Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
              <li>Rules only apply to THAT page and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
              <li>The CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            </ul>
          <li class="special">External CSS Style Sheet</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Most common way to style a webpage.</li>
              <li>This is preferred in most cases because it allows the developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          </ul>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="boldit">Git</span> allows us to works on projects simultaneously with other programmers.</li>
          <li>Git provides version control, ensuring we don't loose our work and can restore previous versions of code when needed.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>cd foldername: navigates to location </li>

        <ul>
          <li>We add <span class="boldit">JavaScript</span> to our HTML structure to make the website interactive.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three important statements:
            <ul>
              <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
              <li>The second statement is the condition.</li>
              <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each time.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the program how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function MUST BE CALLED in order to run.</li>
